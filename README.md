# LangaraCourseInfo

A project to collate information about courses and transfer information at Langara College, Vancouver.

Contains course information from 1999 - present.

Scrapers are provided for several data sources from Langara College and BCTransferGuide.

Once built, the database weighs around 15 MB for all data from 1999 - present (~250 MB with source HTML/PDFs), which should be lightweight enough most uses.

The transfer agreement scraper currently takes an excruciating amount of time - approximately an hour - this will be improved in the future.

# Collected Data

 - Course Information: course description & other attributes
 - Course Offerings: dating from 1999 - present.
 - Transfer Information: only active transfer agreements are collected.
